# StarCalc

A separate app, similar to [SciTool](https://github.com/mdnich/scitool), that aids in calculations for stellar properties.

This was created for use in the US Science Olympiad Astronomy event in 2022-3.

These tools are also a part of [SciTool (Swift)](https://github.com/mdnich/scitool/tree/main). A java implementation is in progress.
